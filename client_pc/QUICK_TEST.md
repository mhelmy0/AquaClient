# Quick RTP Streaming Test

## ‚úÖ Good News!
Your RTP packets **ARE arriving**! The test showed valid RTP/H264 packets from `192.168.100.23:35555`.

## üé• To See Video - Try These:

### Method 1: Direct FFplay (Simplest)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\moham\Downloads\Aqua\client_pc
python create_sdp.py
ffplay -protocol_whitelist file,udp,rtp -i stream.sdp
```

### Method 2: With Better Parameters

```powershell
ffplay -protocol_whitelist file,udp,rtp -fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -probesize 32 -analyzeduration 0 -i stream.sdp
```

### Method 3: VLC Player (if you have it)

```powershell
vlc stream.sdp
```

### Method 4: Use the Updated Simple GUI

```powershell
python simple_rtp_gui.py
# Click "Play Stream" - it now creates SDP file automatically
```

## üîç Why FFplay Window Wasn't Appearing

The issue is FFplay needs:
1. **SDP file** (not just UDP URL) - Now created automatically
2. **Low probesize** - To start quickly without waiting
3. **No analyzeduration** - To not wait for stream analysis

## ‚ú® What Changed

The simple GUI now:
- ‚úÖ Creates `stream.sdp` file automatically
- ‚úÖ Uses SDP file instead of direct UDP URL
- ‚úÖ Has better FFplay parameters
- ‚úÖ Should open video window now!

## üß™ Test Right Now

**Run this command while Pi is streaming:**

```powershell
ffplay -protocol_whitelist file,udp,rtp -i stream.sdp
```

**You should see:**
- FFplay window opens
- Video from your Raspberry Pi appears!

If it still doesn't work, the ffplay console output will tell us why.

**Note:** The SDP file has been created in `client_pc/stream.sdp`
